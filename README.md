# Front-End Developer Assessment
An assessment to review a candidate's qualificiation for the position of Front-End Developer.

## Getting Started

### What You'll Need
* Node.js v6.5.0 or greater
* NPM version 3 or greater (Make sure to do a checking by running `npm --version`. If you need to update, run `npm install npm -g`
* Web browser
* Any editor of your choice

### Start up
Once you clone this repository, you'll need to run `npm install` from the root directory. This will install all of the dependencies such as Grunt, Bower, TypeScript, System.js, etc, as well as install bower dependencies.

Once installed, you will then need to have two consoles open: one for running the local web server, and the second for running a watch on your files to automatically compile and update them as you work and save.

In console #1: run `node index`
_This will start the web server on port 8080 for you to access._

In console #2: run `grunt`
_This will initiate the task runners which run a linter, compile TypeScript, and move over views._

## Futher Information
Once started, more information detailing the actual work will be in the index.html file.

If you need any help or run into issues, please do not hesitate to reach out for help!

## Completion
Once you are satisfied with your module, zip up your directory and email it to nick.george@igtm.com. If you prefer, you can use your favorite cloud provider (OneDrive, Google Cloud, Amazon, Drop Box, etc), too.
